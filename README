ABOUT
=====
The goal of this project is to create a web based Spotify client which can be
used with more than one person in a room. The host can specify a playlist
which should be played, and everybody can add requests to that playlist. This
way it will be possible to have Spotify running during parties or during
worktime.

STATUS
======
Currently the code compiles and runs under Windows. The client code is Java and should
run on every computer available, but the C++ part is Windows dependant where the platform
dependent code is in infloop.h/cpp.

BUILDING
========
The project files are included in the repository. This is an Eclipse project and a MSVC++
solution.
