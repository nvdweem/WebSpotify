ABOUT
=====
The goal of this project is to create a web based Spotify client which can be
used with more than one person in a room. The host can specify a playlist
which should be played, and everybody can add requests to that playlist. This
way it will be possible to have Spotify running during parties or during
worktime.

STATUS
======
The application is being developed under Windows. I tried to compile it for Linux and it 
appears that this works. Compiling the Java sources should be quite straightforward (you
can use the Eclise project). The C++ sources can be compiled with MSVC++ for windows, or
you could use the makefile for Linux binaries (should also work for OSX with XCode 
installed).

At this point the tool is nearing the usable status. The next step will be allowing playing
playlists and queueing songs.

COMPATIBILITY
=============
The tool is verified to compile and run with the following operating systems:
- Windows 7
- Ubuntu 11.04

BUILDING
========
The project files are included in the repository. This is an Eclipse project and a MSVC++
solution. You can also use the Makefile for the C++ files under Linux and OSX.
